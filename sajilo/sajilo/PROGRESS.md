### Database Schema
```prisma
model Car {
  id            String    @id @default(uuid())
  make          String
  model         String
  year          Int
  type          String
  transmission  String
  seats         Int
  pricePerDay   Float
  available     Boolean   @default(true)
  location      String
  imageUrl      String
  description   String?
  features      Json      @default("[]")
  bookings      Booking[]
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model User {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  email     String    @unique
  phone     String?
  password  String

model Booking {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  car         Car      @relation(fields: [carId], references: [id])
  carId       String
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId      String
  startDate   DateTime
  endDate     DateTime
  totalPrice  Float
  status      String   // PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Cars
- `GET /api/cars` - List all cars
- `GET /api/cars/[id]` - Get car details
- `POST /api/cars` - Create new car (admin only)
  - Required fields: make, model, year, type, transmission, seats, pricePerDay, location, imageUrl
- `PUT /api/cars/[id]` - Update car (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/cars/[id]` - Delete car (admin only)

#### Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings` - List all bookings (admin only)
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
  - Required fields: carId, userId, startDate, endDate, totalPrice

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Known Issues
- Database seeding needs to be fixed
- Authentication is not yet implemented
- Booking form needs to be connected to the API
- Error handling needs improvement
